I've been doing a lot more ruminating about my life in the shower than normally. So much so, that it's evolved into meta-shower-rumination and here I am writing a blog post about it. All this thinking has lead me to a behavior that I believe will make me (and maybe you) more productive and less stressed out in the long run: keeping a post-shower brainstorm journal.

This all came about when my normal shower thoughts turned rougue and transformed into meta shower thoughts. I, who has many a time tried mindful meditation but never kept up with it, found myself objectively (as much as you can) examining my own shower musings. I found that in the shower, I take on a level of confidence that is not possible anywhere else in my life. The grandest ideas and biggest projects seem simple and I have a huge rush of motivation to go accomplish these feats. Whether this is because in the shower it's easy to overlook the fact that creating the next Facebook is probably gonna take a little longer than a weekend or because I can't actually act on these projects is irrelevant. I've found that writing down these ideas after the shower (and I mean _right after_ the shower), no matter how grand or complex, has been a big help in actually motivating me to take steps toward some of these things. If nothing else, I've found (like many others have most likely found), that writing down these nagging tasks that pop up in your mind solidifies them in the real world. This makes them pop up less when I find myself alone with my thoughts (the horror!).

All you need to do this yourself is a notebook and a shower. Your "shower" doesn't even have to be a shower. If you're one of those awesome people who meditates frequently, you can take a few minutes afterward to write down the ideas that drifted into your head (but you made note of them and let them drift away, of course). I personally take the notes on my phone. I don't even adhere to any specific format for the notes. I actually find that the stream of conciousness style of note-taking I do is really effective.

Here are a few of the things that I've done since starting this shower journal:

* Wrote this blog post!
* Started learning [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), and [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/).
* Started a stretching and mobility routine (to fix my thrice-sprained ankles).

I hope to keep this up for a few months and write another post with my experiences and improvements on this very informal process!

Until next time,


Nick
